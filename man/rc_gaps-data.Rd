\title{Plant Diversity in Forest Gaps on the Robinson Crusoe Island}
\description{
Data set with floristic composition, size and type of gaps sampled in forest
stands of the Robinson Crusoe Island (Chile).
}
\usage{
data(rc_gaps)
data(rc_gaps.env)
}
\details{
The data is contained in two separated objects.
The vegetation table (\code{rc_gaps}) is formatted as a presence/absence matrix
with the gaps (units) as rows and the species as columns.
The data frame \code{rc_gaps.env} contains information about the surface size of
the gaps (in squared metres), the type and the size rank (see
\bold{Vargas et al. 2013}).
