# Lexiguel
A mingle-mangle of functions for R, most of them related to publications done by
maintainer.
Thus would you like to implement some plots or analyses done in one of my
publications?
Then, `Lexiguel` is the proper place to exchange requests and answers.

Thanks to **Kerstin**, my girlfriend, for the crazy name.


## Updating to the last version of Lexiguel
You may have previously installed the R-package
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).
Then execute following commands in your R-session:


```r
library(devtools)
install_github("kamapu/Lexiguel")
```
